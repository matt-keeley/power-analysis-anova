# ANOVA Power Simulation

**Tech Stack:** R

## About the Project
This project simulates how violations of ANOVA assumptions affect statistical power and Type I error rates. It provides guidance for researchers on selecting the most appropriate statistical test, particularly when sample sizes are small and reliable data is scarce.  

By comparing ANOVA with a non-parametric alternative, the permutation test, across various experimental conditions, the simulation identifies circumstances where each method performs optimally.

## Features
- Simulates datasets under varying combinations of factors and assumption violations  
- Evaluates power and Type I error rates under different scenarios  
- Provides insights into when non-parametric methods may be preferable
